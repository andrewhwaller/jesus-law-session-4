# Ritual impurity
1. Unavoidable, sometimes natural, and part of everyday life.
2. Can be contracted from objects or substances.
3. Can be transmitted to others directly and indirectly.
4. Removed by time, ritual washing, and sometimes sacrifice.
5. ***Not*** sinful! It is not a sin to become ritually impure.

<br/>

# Moral impurity
1. Avoidable.
2. Caused by grave sin, but cannot be spread through social contagion.
3. Pollutes the land of Israel.
4. Typically can be removed via atonement or punishment, but sometimes irremovable.
5. ***Absolutely*** sinful.

# Luke 5:12--14
“Once, when he was in one of the cities, there was a man covered with \[*lepra*\]. When he saw Jesus, he bowed with his face to the ground and begged him, ‘Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean.’ Then Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and said, ‘I do choose. Be made clean.’ Immediately the \[*lepra*\] left him. And he ordered him to tell no one. ‘Go,’ he said, ‘and show yourself to the priest, and, as Moses commanded, make an offering for your cleansing, for a testimony to them.’”
